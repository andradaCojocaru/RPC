# 342C1 Andrada-Ioana Cojocaru

Server Implementation
All the necessary information (clients, resources, permissions) is read from all
the files given in the command line - all operations are in tema1_svc.c.
tema1_server.c
* request_authorization -> the user ID is received, and if a user with this ID is
found, a request token is generated; otherwise, USER_NOT_FOUND will be displayed.
* approve_request_token -> associates the user with the ID of the current
permission found in all approvals.If the permission "*" is encountered, then the
* request_access_token -> If the token is signed, then the generation of an access
token can begin. If it has automatic refresh, a refresh token is also generated,
and these details are displayed on the screen.user will not sign the token.
These details are saved in the corresponding tokens for each user in the user_db.
* validate_delegated_action -> check for the given id in the users db. If the
token expired and it is automatically refresh than we must make the same thing
to generate new tokens, if not, the token must be erased. If the token is not
found, expired, not the good one for the file or the type permission we must
display some errors, if not the request is accepted


Client Implementation
Lines are read from the command line one by one, and depending on the type of
operation, it is checked at the request whether it is a refresh or not. The
operation is then carried out by calling the functions from the server:
REQUEST_AUTHORIZATION, APPROVE_REQUEST_TOKEN, REQUEST_ACCESS_TOKEN. Relevant
messages are displayed based on the received statuses.


Testing
for testing run:
make -f Makefile.tema1
./check.sh all
I put '\n' in all server.out, client.out files
